  <h2>About me</h2>
<p> 

 I am Arshpreet kaur.I am a student of Interactive media design program at Algonquin college. Basically,
 I am from india ,but when i was in high school, i made my plan to study abroad and then in came here.
 Initially , my interest was in computer science but now designing and photography attracts me more ,
  therefore i changed my program and want to explore my career in this field now.</p>
 <p>
    Apart from studies, i also do a partime job to get experience of the outside world.I like to read and listen
  motivational thoughts and quotes and one of my favourite from them is <strong> " Work hard in silence , let
 your success be your noise".</strong>.I am extrovert type of personality,i like to talk with new people 
 and that is the reason i have a lot of friends.I love to serve the needy and poor people.I have a wish in my life 
 to do something big for them to make them their faces smile because according to me <strong>
    "Happiness is not something when you are happy,but its all about when you make other people'faces smile because of you."
 </strong>
